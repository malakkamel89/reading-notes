# what is HTMl?
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a computer language that makes up most web pages and online applications. A hypertext is a text that is used to reference other pieces of text, while a markup language is a series of markings that tells web servers the style and structure of a document. 

HTML is not considered a programming language as it can’t create dynamic functionality. Instead, with HTML, web users can create and structure sections, paragraphs, and links using elements, tags, and attributes. 
Here are some of the most common uses for HTML:

Web development. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. 
Internet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. 
Web documentation. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.

HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. A web browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it.

All HTML pages have a series of HTML elements, consisting of a set of tags and attributes. HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. A tag tells the web browser where an element begins and ends, whereas an attribute describes the characteristics of an element. 
The three main parts of an element are: 

Opening tag – used to state where an element starts to take effect. The tag is wrapped with opening and closing angle brackets. For example, use the start tag <p> to create a paragraph. 
Content – this is the output that other users see. 
Closing tag – the same as the opening tag, but with a forward slash before the element name. For example, </p> to end a paragraph. 
The combination of these three parts will create an HTML element:
