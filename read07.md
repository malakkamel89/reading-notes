Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

 ## what are the ways to creat a function ?
 1. function declaration :it will consists 
 the name of the function.
A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.

Such a function can be anonymous; it does not have to have a name. For example, the function square could have been defined as:

const square = function(number) { return number * number }
var x = square(4) // x gets the value 16
